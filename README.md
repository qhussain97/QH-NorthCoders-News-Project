If you wish to clone this project and run it locally you will need to carry out some instructions first:

We'll have two databases in this project. One for real looking dev data and another for simpler test data.

You will need to create two .env files for your project: .env.test and .env.development. Into each, add PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names). Double check that these .env files are .gitignored.
